The completed sculpture was installed in Youlgrave Church on 31st July 2018, where it was inaugurated and blessed,  before being dismantled mid August.

On the 19th August it was reassembled in St Martin's Cathedral, Ypres, Belgium.

The sculpture was designed to split into two. In the five years since then, one half has been displayed in All Saints' Youlgrave and the other in St Martin's Ypres. In August 2023 the two halves were exchanged.
