The oak was from a storm damaged tree which had been down for couple of years. It was donated by the Duke of Devonshire from his Chatsworth Estate.

The planed wood clearly shows signs of rot, which was initially disappointing but in retrospect made the church towers more interesting visually. It had to be chemically treated after completion.
