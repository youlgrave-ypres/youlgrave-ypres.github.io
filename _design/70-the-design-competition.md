Phil Smith entered the competition within the three local parishes to design a 3D sculpture which would stand alone when split into two halves......  he won, below is his concept on how the sculpture should work .

The sculpture was made after a summer of training a team in stained glass skills.

It stands about 2m high, consisting of a base of local lime stone pillars supporting an oak wheel of stained glass lit from beneath. Through the centre rises an oak trunk – from the Chatsworth Estate of the Duke of Devonshire. It is organically carved in clean but natural, lines, as the spire of Ypres Cathedral and the tower of All Saints, Youlgreave. Four arches cross the central pillars in two bell shapes of stained glass, representing four related subjects. Sacrifice, Reconciliation, the Link, and Hope.

The sculpture is shared between Youlgrave and Ypres. It can be split into two parts so that it can be moved in part or completely between locations. The sections are used at relevant times and in particular at Remembrance Services each November. The sculpture is a physical recognition of the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1 and will be a lasting sign of the spirit of remembrance in both communities for years to come. Also it will be a reminder to all that military conflict is to be avoided in years to come.
