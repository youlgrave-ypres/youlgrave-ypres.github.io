title: Youlgrave Band

One of the two coaches transported the band which played in the Square ( we were 2hrs late ) within 45 mins of us arriving...... such commitment. One of the many highlights was the band playing under the Menin Gate before and after the last post on the Sunday evening.

The band played 6 times in all during the visit.... playing the Last Post at some of the cemeteries on either of the two WWI Bugles the band brought over ... very moving.
