The group’s ideas grew into the presentation of a sculpture to Ypres Cathedral, and community, Belgium on 19th August 2018, accompanied by the Youlgrave Silver Band, who will play at the Menin Gate and at concerts, All Saints Bell ringers, supported by the best from over the country, who will ring a unique peal for 3hrs, WW1 bugle playing, two coaches of 100 people, and TV crew. The sculpture is of oak, stone and stained glass, 2m x 1m x 1m, designed and built by village volunteers with help, and donations of materials from many interested local craftsmen. Some volunteers already had skills, but many have trained just for this project.

The finished sculpture will stand in the church in August, before it travels to Belgium

A competition was held last summer, through the villages or Youlgrave, Alport, Middleton, Stanton, and Birchover, with leaflets to every house inviting anyone to submit ideas in any way they wanted, so the design could truly be from the people.

Many of the ideas are incorporated, particularly from the children, such as the three crosses, faceless soldier, river running through. There is a full representation of a child’s drawing in one of the panels.
