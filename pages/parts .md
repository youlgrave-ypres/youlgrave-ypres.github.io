Each element of the sculpture is symbolic.  A symbolism drawn from the respective communities of Ypres and Youlgrave, their geography, economies and cultures. However it is the dreadful events of World War One that cement the ties between them and this memorial seeks to recognise that history.  But it also seeks to further the Link, to express hope for the future and it rues the failings of the past in an attempt at reconciliation.
Some of the more important symbolisms are explained in the following pages.
