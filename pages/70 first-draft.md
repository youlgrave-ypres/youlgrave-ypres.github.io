Phil Smith entered the competition within the three local parishes to design a 3D sculpture which would stand alone when split into two halves......  he won, below is his concept on how the sculpture should work .

The sculpture is being made after a summer of training a team in stained glass skills.

It will be about 2m high, consisting of a base of local lime stone pillars supporting a oak wheel of stained glass lit from beneath. Through the centre there will rise an oak trunk – from Chatsworth. It will look organically carved in clean but natural, lines, as the spire of Ypres Cathedral and the tower of All Saints, Youlgreave, signifying a better future. Four arches will cross the central oak in two bell shapes of stained glass, representing four related subjects. Sacrifice, reconciliation, the link, and future hope.

In the longer term it is intended to share the sculpture with Ypres. It is designed to be split into two parts so that it can be moved in part or completely between Ypres and Youlgrave. This will enable it to be used at relevant events in the future and in particular at remembrance services in November each year. The sculpture will be a physical recognition of the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1 and a lasting sign of the spirit of remembrance in both communities for years to come. Also it will be a reminder to all that military conflict is to be avoided in years to come. The band and the communities will have a physical reminder of the cost of war and a further reason to remember Rennie Compton Waterhouse and his comrades from Youlgrave in the future.
