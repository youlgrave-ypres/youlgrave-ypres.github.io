The round is formed from two semi-circular table tops. They have been created mainly using clear, textured glass to allow light through and are enhanced by LED lighting.

The segments have an outer rim ribbon of poppy red 'petals'. The last section on one features the black, yellow and red of the Belgian flag, whist the other shows the red, white and blue of the Union Jack.

Within the 'Belgian' sector is featured a daisy - at one time the Belgian flower of remembrance, next to this is a line depicting the Western Front through France and Flanders. The red dots represent some of the major battlefields and the resulting cemeteries or memorials there.

The na√Øvely drawn house, road and poppies allude to some of the designs submitted by children from All Saints' Church of England Primary School in Youlgreave.

This scene continues onto the other semicircle to be followed by the outline of the Menin Gate in Ypres - over this is outlined an aerial view of the circular rows of headstones to be found at Tyne Cott Memorial.

The next section features the Union Jack before leading into a depiction, mainly in plain textured glass of one of the roundels in the Rennie Waterhouse memorial window this continues into the other half thus completing the full circle.
