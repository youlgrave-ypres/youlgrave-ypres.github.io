2018 - MMXVIII

1914-1918 - MCMXIV-XVIII

The Tank
: With troops in the battlefield trenches the tank, complete with entrenching beam rumbles off, as the Tank Corps motto says, "through the mud, and the blood, to the green fields beyond". After serving in the Life Guards, Charles Waterhouse became a Captain in the Tank Corps. John Samuel Glossop from Youlgreave, after initially serving in the Derbyshire Yeomanry, later transferred to the Tank Corps.

The Lion
: The lion depicted lies atop the East End of the Menin Gate Memorial. Recorded on the Menin Gate are the names of 54,896 missing from August 1914 to August 1915. On panel 41 appears the name of lance Corporal William Wragg from Caldwell End, Youlgreave.

Linen and Hops
: The encapsulated piece of antique Belgian Linen symbolises the country's past heritage and the hops allude to its fine brewing history.

Military Cross
: On 29 January 1920 this was awarded to the City of Ypres by the British Government and a M.C. ribbon is encapsulated here.

The League of Nations (1920-1946)
: Founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference. It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to make world peace. The United Nations replaced it after the end of World War Two.

Dates
: The dates 1914-1918 are often seen on war memorials, sometimes 1914-1919 is recorded. The Great War began on 4 August 1914 with the Armistice coming into effect on 11 November 1918. It was not until the Versailles Peace Conference of 28 June 1919 that the war officially ended, hence the variations in dates often seen.

World
: The coloured areas depicted on the land mass of the world show those countries not engaged in the conflict.

Local Stone
: The five slivers of stone are from the centre out: Limestone; Galena (lead ore); Stalactite Section; Sedimentary Calcite; Sandstone.
The first four were obtained from the mineral cave system under a house in Middleton-by-Youlgreave in June 2018, whilst a small section of Derbyshire Blue John from Treak Cliff Cavern is adjacent the League of Nations cross.
