Depicting the link between the communities of Youlgreave and Ypres

St Martin's Cathedral, Ypres
: Originally constructed in 1370, the present cathedral, like most of the city, was completely rebuilt following its total destruction during WW1.
  
  It was from here, and other nearby churches in 1914-1915 that Charles Waterhouse of Lombard Hall, serving with the 1st Life Guards salved stained glass fragments and with appropriate permissions, brought them back. They were later incorporated into the Waterhouse Memorial window to his younger brother Rennie.

Belgian Flag
: The black, yellow and red bands of the Belgian flag highlight the 103 feet tall spire of St Martin's in this quadrant.

All Saints' Church, Youlgreave
: Grade 1 listed, 252 miles (as the crow flies) from St Martin's dates from the 12th century. Nikolaus Pevsner describes it as "one of the most impressive Churches of Derbyshire".

  With its fine Burne-Jones East Window, it was the smaller memorial window on the North Aisle, which was the creative idea for this stained- glass memorial. The roundel contained here is based on the fragments within this window.

The Red, White and Blue Flag
: Based on the Regimental Colours of 1/6th Battalion Notts and Derby (Sherwood Foresters) Regiment. The colours are laid up in the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield (Crooked Spire Church). Men from Youlgreave Parish served in this local battalion.
