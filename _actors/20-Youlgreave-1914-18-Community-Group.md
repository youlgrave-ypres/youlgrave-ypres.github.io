From 2014 until 2018 the Group organised many events and services and researched, in particular, those local soldiers who lost their lives for their country. Appropriate services of remembrance were held to honour each brave man lost.
During this time the Group considered how best to commemorate the cessation of hostilities and the subsequent Armistice. Their ideas grew into a project to present a sculpture to Ypres Cathedral and community in Belgium on 19th August 2018. 
The band played many concerts and the last post on two WW1 bugles and the ringers, supported by the best from over the country, rang a unique peal over 3hrs.

The sculpture is of oak, stone and stained glass, 2m x 1m x 1m, designed and built by village volunteers with help, and donations of materials from many interested local craftsmen. Some volunteers already had skills, but many trained just for this project.

The finished sculpture stood in the church in August 2018, before it travelled to Belgium

A competition was held in summer 2017, through the villages or Youlgrave, Alport, Middleton, Stanton, and Birchover, with leaflets to every house inviting anyone to submit ideas in any way they wanted, so the design could truly be from the people.

Many of the ideas submitted are incorporated, particularly from the children, such as the three crosses, the faceless soldier and the river running through. There is even a full representation of a childâ€™s drawing in the panels.
