The story begins in 1922 when Charles Waterhouse installed two stained glass windows and a banner in Youlgrave All Saints church in memory of his brother Rennie Compton Waterhouse who was killed at Gallipoli in 1915. The stained glass for the windows was gathered from the ruins of Ypres Cathedral in Belgium and now exists in the beautiful stained glass memorial windows.

This event has linked the communities of Youlgrave and Ypres since that time. 2018 being the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1,is an opportunity to cement the established link and take it on in the future.

Youlgrave Silver Band has the opportunity to contribute to an event in August which will do just that. The Youlgrave 1914 / 18 Community Group is creating a sculpture in memory of the local men killed in WW1. This sculpture is to be presented to the people of Ypres at a ceremony in Ypres Cathedral in August 2018.

The arrangements for the presentation are made. Two coaches have been hired to take the Silver Band, Bell Ringers, People from the village and the team involved making this beautiful sculpture.

Youlgrave Silver band will play at the presentation of the sculpture in Ypres cathedral, and three other concerts at related venues and be involved in the “Last Post” ceremony at the Menin Gate war memorial.
