If you look closely at the stained glass section, can you find...

3. Pictures drawn by Youlgrave primary school students.

4. St Martin’s Cathedral in Ypres.

5. A British Bi-plane. The ‘Sopwith Camel’, representing another terrifying development of war.  Attack from the air.

6. The original Belgian flower of Remembrance. Today the poppy is also used.

7. A plan of the battle lines of the Western Front and the locations of many of the cemeteries for the soldiers killed in battle there.

8. Derbyshire Limestone, Fluorspar, Galena and Gritstone.  Also, Blue John, a form of fluorspar often used for jewellery.
