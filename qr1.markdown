## On display

The sculpture on display here is made up of the [Centenary](symbolism/centenary-quadrant) and [Link](symbolism/link-quadrant) quadrants.

If you look closely at the stained glass section, can you find...

1. Soldiers in a trench.

2. There are two lions; can you find them both?

3. A carrier pigeon used to send messages, and this one is carrying a camera too.

4. The Unknown Soldier’s face.  Or could it have been you? (The mirror was suggested by Youlgrave's primary school students).

5. Hops & Barley, denoting Belgium's excellent reputation for brewing beer.

6. Multi denominational gravestones.

7. Soil from Ypres. There is also soil from Youlgreave.

8. A piece of traditional antique Belgian linen.

9. The Menin Gate Memorial and gravestones. 

10. A World War 1 Tank. This one represents a Mark 5 example. The tank was a new form of warfare, its size and power putting dread into the minds of those who faced it.
